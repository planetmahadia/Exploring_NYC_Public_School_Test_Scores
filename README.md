# DataCamp Project #2
Primarily using pandas to access a dataframe of NYC school math scores & manipulate, visualise and analyse the distribution of scores across schools.

'Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.'

Provided with schools.csv & tasked with answering 3 key questions
1. Which 10 schools produce the best math results? The best math results are at least 80% of the maximum possible score of 800 for math
2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?
3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?
